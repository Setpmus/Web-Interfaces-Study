> A place to keep and test everything I'm learning about code.

What's up! I made this repo to be my public "notebook". Basically, everything I study about logic, algorithms, and testing in Python ends up here.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's the Deal?

The idea is simple: have a spot to organize the code I write for college and other courses. It's a way to track my progress and not lose what I've learned.

**What you'll find inside:**
* Some algorithms to mess with.
* Tests for different concepts and data structures.
* My first adventures in software testing.
* Random scripts just for practice.

## My Toolkit

Here's what I'm using for this project:

## How It's Organized

No big mystery, the structure is pretty straightforward:
